# Expressions

```{r setup, include = FALSE}

```

```{r}
library(rlang)
```

The structure of code is a tree. The leaves of the tree are constants and names. The branches of the tree are calls. Define graphical conventions.

The AST is usally construcuted from a string, by parsing code. The opposite operation is deparsing. But you can also modify the tree by hand, and insert any R object. This can be useful when you need to override the usual lookup rules.

## Structure of expressions {#structure-of-expressions}

To compute on the language, we first need to understand the structure of the language. That will require some new vocabulary, some new tools, and some new ways of thinking about R code. The first thing you'll need to understand is the distinction between an operation and a result: \index{expressions}

```{r}
x <- 4
y <- x * 10
y
```

We want to distinguish the action of multiplying `x` by 10 and assigning that result to `y` from the actual result (40). You can capture the action with `quote()`:

```{r}
z <- quote(y <- x * 10)
z
```

`quote()` returns an __expression__: an object that represents an action that can be performed by R. (Unfortunately `expression()` does not return an expression in this sense. Instead, it returns something more like a list of expressions. See [parsing and deparsing](#parsing-and-deparsing) for more details.) \indexc{quote()}

An expression is also called an abstract syntax tree (AST) because it represents the hierarchical tree structure of the code. We'll use `pryr::ast()` to see this more clearly: \index{abstract syntax tree} \indexc{ast()}

```{r}
ast(y <- x * 10)
```

There are four possible components of an expression: constants, names, calls, and pairlists.

* __constants__ include the length one atomic vectors, like `"a"` or `10`,
   and `NULL`. `ast()` displays them as is. \index{constants}

    ```{r}
    ast("a")
    ast(1)
    ast(1L)
    ast(TRUE)
    ```

    Quoting a constant returns it unchanged:

    ```{r}
    identical(1, quote(1))
    identical("test", quote("test"))
    ```

* __names__, or symbols, represent the name of an object rather than its value.
   `ast()` prefixes names with a backtick. \index{names} \index{symbols|see{names}}

    ```{r}
    ast(x)
    ast(mean)
    ast(`an unusual name`)
    ```

* __calls__ represent the action of calling a function. Like lists, calls are
  recursive: they can contain constants, names, pairlists, and other calls.
  `ast()` prints `()` and then lists the children. The first child is the
  function that is called, and the remaining children are the function's 
  arguments. \index{calls}

    ```{r}
    ast(f())
    ast(f(1, 2))
    ast(f(a, b))
    ast(f(g(), h(1, a)))
    ```

    As mentioned in
    [every operation is a function call](#all-calls),
    even things that don't look like function calls still have this
    hierarchical structure:

    ```{r}
    ast(a + b)
    ast(if (x > 1) x else 1/x)
    ```

* __pairlists__, short for dotted pair lists, are a legacy of R's past.
  They are only used in one place: the formal arguments of a function.
  `ast()` prints `[]` at the top-level of a pairlist. Like calls, pairlists
  are also recursive and can contain constants, names, and calls.
  \index{pairlists}

    ```{r}
    ast(function(x = 1, y) x)
    ast(function(x = 1, y = x * 2) {x / y})
    ```

Note that `str()` does not follow these naming conventions when describing objects. Instead, it describes names as symbols and calls as language objects:

```{r}
str(quote(a))
str(quote(a + b))
```

Using low-level functions, it is possible to create call trees that contain objects other than constants, names, calls, and pairlists. The following example uses `substitute()` to insert a data frame into a call tree. This is a bad idea, however, because the object does not print correctly: the printed call looks like it should return "list" but when evaluated, it returns "data.frame". \indexc{substitute()}

```{r}
class_df <- substitute(class(df), list(df = data.frame(x = 10)))
class_df
eval(class_df)
```

Together these four components define the structure of all R code. They are explained in more detail in the following sections.

### Exercises

1.  There's no existing base function that checks if an element is
    a valid component of an expression (i.e., it's a constant, name,
    call, or pairlist). Implement one by guessing the names of the "is"
    functions for calls, names, and pairlists.

1.  `pryr::ast()` uses non-standard evaluation. What's its escape hatch to
    standard evaluation?

1.  What does the call tree of an if statement with multiple else conditions
    look like?

1.  Compare `ast(x + y %+% z)` to `ast(x ^ y %+% z)`. What do they
    tell you about the precedence of custom infix functions?

1.  Why can't an expression contain an atomic vector of length greater than one?
    Which one of the six types of atomic vector can't appear in an expression?
    Why?

## Names {#names}

Typically, we use `quote()` to capture names. You can also convert a string to a name with `as.name()`. However, this is most useful only when your function receives strings as input. Otherwise it involves more typing than using `quote()`. (You can use `is.name()` to test if an object is a name.) \index{names} \indexc{as.name()}

```{r}
as.name("name")
identical(quote(name), as.name("name"))

is.name("name")
is.name(quote(name))
is.name(quote(f(name)))
```

(Names are also called symbols. `as.symbol()` and `is.symbol()` are identical to `as.name()` and `is.name()`.)

Names that would otherwise be invalid are automatically surrounded by backticks:
\index{non-syntactic names}

```{r}
as.name("a b")
as.name("if")
```

There's one special name that needs a little extra discussion: the empty name. It is used to represent missing arguments. This object behaves strangely. You can't bind it to a variable. If you do, it triggers an error about missing arguments. It's only useful if you want to programmatically create a function with missing arguments. \index{names|empty}

```{r, error = TRUE}
f <- function(x) 10
formals(f)$x
is.name(formals(f)$x)
as.character(formals(f)$x)

missing_arg <- formals(f)$x
# Doesn't work!
is.name(missing_arg)
```

To explicitly create it when needed, call `quote()` with a named argument:

```{r}
quote(expr =)
```

### Exercises

1.  You can use `formals()` to both get and set the arguments of a function.
    Use `formals()` to modify the following function so that the default value
    of `x` is missing and `y` is 10.

    ```{r}
    g <- function(x = 20, y) {
      x + y
    }
    ```

1.  Write an equivalent to `get()` using `as.name()` and `eval()`. Write an
    equivalent to `assign()` using `as.name()`, `substitute()`, and `eval()`.
    (Don't worry about the multiple ways of choosing an environment; assume
    that the user supplies it explicitly.)

## Calls {#calls}

A call is very similar to a list. It has `length`, `[[` and `[` methods, and is recursive because calls can contain other calls. The first element of the call is the function that gets called. It's usually the _name_ of a function: \index{calls}

```{r}
x <- quote(read.csv("important.csv", row.names = FALSE))
x[[1]]
is.name(x[[1]])
```

But it can also be another call:

```{r}
y <- quote(add(10)(20))
y[[1]]
is.call(y[[1]])
```

The remaining elements are the arguments. They can be extracted by name or by position.

```{r}
x <- quote(read.csv("important.csv", row.names = FALSE))
x[[2]]
x$row.names
names(x)
```

The length of a call minus 1 gives the number of arguments:

```{r}
length(x) - 1
```

There are many ways to supply the arguments to a function. 
To work around this problem, pryr provides `standardise_call()`. It uses the base `match.call()` function to convert all positional arguments to named arguments: \indexc{standardise\_call()} \indexc{match.call()}

### Exercises

1.  The following two calls look the same, but are actually different:

    ```{r}
    (a <- call("mean", 1:10))
    (b <- call("mean", quote(1:10)))
    identical(a, b)
    ```

    What's the difference? Which one should you prefer?

1.  Implement a pure R version of `do.call()`.

1.  Concatenating a call and an expression with `c()` creates a list. Implement
    `concat()` so that the following code works to combine a call and
    an additional argument.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    concat(quote(f), a = 1, b = quote(mean(a)))
    #> f(a = 1, b = mean(a))
    ```

1.  Since `list()`s don't belong in expressions, we could create a more
    convenient call constructor that automatically combines lists into the
    arguments. Implement `make_call()` so that the following code works.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    make_call(quote(mean), list(quote(x), na.rm = TRUE))
    #> mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
    make_call(quote(mean), quote(x), na.rm = TRUE)
    #> mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
    ```

1.  How does `mode<-` work? How does it use `call()`?

1.  Read the source for `pryr::standardise_call()`. How does it work?
    Why is `is.primitive()` needed?

1.  `standardise_call()` doesn't work so well for the following calls.
    Why?

    ```{r}
    standardise_call(quote(mean(1:10, na.rm = TRUE)))
    standardise_call(quote(mean(n = T, 1:10)))
    standardise_call(quote(mean(x = 1:10, , TRUE)))
    ```

1.  Read the documentation for `pryr::modify_call()`. How do you think
    it works? Read the source code.

1.  Use `ast()` and experimentation to figure out the three arguments in an
    `if()` call. Which components are required? What are the arguments to
    the `for()` and `while()` calls?


## Pairlists {#pairlists}

Pairlists are a holdover from R's past. They behave identically to lists, but have a different internal representation (as a linked list rather than a vector). Pairlists have been replaced by lists everywhere except in function arguments. \index{pairlists}

The only place you need to care about the difference between a list and a pairlist is if you're going to construct functions by hand. For example, the following function allows you to construct a function from its component pieces: a list of formal arguments, a body, and an environment. The function uses `as.pairlist()` to ensure that the `function()` has the pairlist of `args` it needs. \indexc{as.pairlist()} \indexc{make\_function()} \index{functions!creating with code}

```{r, eval = FALSE}
make_function <- function(args, body, env = parent.frame()) {
  args <- as.pairlist(args)

  eval(call("function", args, body), env)
}
```

This function is also available in pryr, where it does a little extra checking of arguments. `make_function()` is best used in conjunction with `alist()`, the **a**rgument list function. `alist()` doesn't evaluate its arguments so that `alist(x = a)` is shorthand for `list(x = quote(a))`.

```{r}
add <- make_function(alist(a = 1, b = 2), quote(a + b))
add(1)
add(1, 2)

# To have an argument with no default, you need an explicit =
make_function(alist(a = , b = a), quote(a + b))
# To take `...` as an argument put it on the LHS of =
make_function(alist(a = , b = , ... =), quote(a + b))
```

`make_function()` has one advantage over using closures to construct functions: with it, you can easily read the source code. For example:

```{r}
adder <- function(x) {
  make_function(alist(y =), substitute({x + y}), parent.frame())
}
adder(10)
```

One useful application of `make_function()` is in functions like `curve()`. `curve()` allows you to plot a mathematical function without creating an explicit R function:

```{r curve-demo, fig.width = 3.5, fig.height = 2.5, small_mar = TRUE}
curve(sin(exp(4 * x)), n = 1000)
```

Here `x` is a pronoun. `x` doesn't represent a single concrete value, but is instead a placeholder that varies over the range of the plot. One way to implement `curve()` would be with `make_function()`:

```{r curve2}
curve2 <- function(expr, xlim = c(0, 1), n = 100, 
                   env = parent.frame()) {
  f <- make_function(alist(x = ), substitute(expr), env)

  x <- seq(xlim[1], xlim[2], length = n)
  y <- f(x)

  plot(x, y, type = "l", ylab = deparse(substitute(expr)))
}
```

Functions that use a pronoun are called [anaphoric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphora_(linguistics)) functions. They are used in [Arc](http://www.arcfn.com/doc/anaphoric.html) (a lisp like language), [Perl](http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=666047), and [Clojure](http://amalloy.hubpages.com/hub/Unhygenic-anaphoric-Clojure-macros-for-fun-and-profit). \index{anaphoric functions} \index{functions!anaphoric}

### Exercises

1.  How are `alist(a)` and `alist(a = )` different? Think about both the
    input and the output.

1.  Read the documentation and source code for `pryr::partial()`. What does it
    do? How does it work? Read the documentation and source code for
    `pryr::unenclose()`. What does it do and how does it work?

1.  The actual implementation of `curve()` looks more like

    ```{r curve3}
    curve3 <- function(expr, xlim = c(0, 1), n = 100,
                       env = parent.frame()) {
      env2 <- new.env(parent = env)
      env2$x <- seq(xlim[1], xlim[2], length = n)

      y <- eval(substitute(expr), env2)
      plot(env2$x, y, type = "l", 
        ylab = deparse(substitute(expr)))
    }
    ```

    How does this approach differ from `curve2()` defined above?

## Parsing and deparsing {#parsing-and-deparsing}

Sometimes code is represented as a string, rather than as an expression. You can convert a string to an expression with `parse()`. `parse()` is the opposite of `deparse()`: it takes a character vector and returns an expression object. The primary use of `parse()` is parsing files of code to disk, so the first argument is a file path. Note that if you have code in a character vector, you need to use the `text` argument: \indexc{parse()}

```{r}
z <- quote(y <- x * 10)
deparse(z)

parse(text = deparse(z))
```

Because there might be many top-level calls in a file, `parse()` doesn't return just a single expression. Instead, it returns an expression object, which is essentially a list of expressions: \index{expression object} 

```{r}
exp <- parse(text = c("
  x <- 4
  x
  5
"))
length(exp)
typeof(exp)

exp[[1]]
exp[[2]]
```

You can create expression objects by hand with `expression()`, but I wouldn't recommend it. There's no need to learn about this esoteric data structure if you already know how to use expressions. \indexc{expression()}

With `parse()` and `eval()`, it's possible to write a simple version of `source()`. We read in the file from disk, `parse()` it and then `eval()` each component in a specified environment. This version defaults to a new environment, so it doesn't affect existing objects. `source()` invisibly returns the result of the last expression in the file, so `simple_source()` does the same. \index{source()}

```{r}
simple_source <- function(file, envir = new.env()) {
  stopifnot(file.exists(file))
  stopifnot(is.environment(envir))

  lines <- readLines(file, warn = FALSE)
  exprs <- parse(text = lines)

  n <- length(exprs)
  if (n == 0L) return(invisible())

  for (i in seq_len(n - 1)) {
    eval(exprs[i], envir)
  }
  invisible(eval(exprs[n], envir))
}
```

The real `source()` is considerably more complicated because it can `echo` input and output, and also has many additional settings to control behaviour.

### Exercises

1.  What are the differences between `quote()` and `expression()`?

1.  Read the help for `deparse()` and construct a call that `deparse()`
    and `parse()` do not operate symmetrically on.

1.  Compare and contrast `source()` and `sys.source()`.

1.  Modify `simple_source()` so it returns the result of _every_ expression,
    not just the last one.

1.  The code generated by `simple_source()` lacks source references. Read
    the source code for `sys.source()` and the help for `srcfilecopy()`,
    then modify `simple_source()` to preserve source references. You can
    test your code by sourcing a function that contains a comment. If
    successful, when you look at the function, you'll see the comment and
    not just the source code.
